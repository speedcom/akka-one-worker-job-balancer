# Akka One Worker Job Balancer

## Introduction:
This application shows how single pair of master-worker actors handle jobs generated by client.

## Motivation:
There are some situations where we can't produce more workers because of different scenarios like:
- business establishment,
- hardware limitation,
- single execution context on virtual machine (e.g spark)

## Facts:
1. We have only two actors in our system:
  1. master: responsible for queueing jobs and its further propagation to worker
  2. worker: responsible for processing passed job
* Master Actor is supervisor of Worker Actor.
* Its done in work-pulling manner (worker asks master for job).
* Thanks to delegation of job to Worker we get rid of well-known 'Error Kernel Pattern'.

### Caveats of current solution (what should be done better):
1. Asking for jobs should be an idempotent operation (messages can be lost).
- Own implementation of Supervisor's hierarchy (?)
